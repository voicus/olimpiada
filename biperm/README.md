# -biperm

Let us consider all the natural values from 1 to n, each taken twice. Put into random order, we will now arrange them on 2 lines of n elements each, which we will call a bipermutation. A perfect bipermutation is a bipermutation where every number from 1 to n appears once on each line. On the bipermutation given in input we may do a single operation which is to swap the two elements that are on the same column.

In output file, the number of distinct perfect bipermutations that can be made from the given bipermutation, the minimum amount of operations needed to reach a perfect bipermutation and an example of a perfect bipermutation that can be made with a minimum amount of swaps.
